                A bunch of heavy words with a strangely beautiful aura around them. Ancient. Hold the potential to move people to tears. Invisible, but have fuelled heated debates for years. Invisible, but their presence has won many battles. Invisible, but their absence has nearly wiped off sections of human populations. Provides power to the speaker- often misused, usually by elders holding power. <br>

                    We’ve all heard tales of the lives of powerful queens and mighty kings. Ever noticed how the legendary ones were somehow always those who followed their hearts over logic, stood by their people in times of crises, and went to great lengths- all just to keep a promise?<br>
                    Legends were always the ones with... strong ethics?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Out of the millions of species inhabiting the planet, just why are we humans the civilised ones (at least, in the traditional sense)? These untold yet constantly preached rules that every one of us is taught right from birth- are <i>they</i> the reason? Morals hidden deep within those childish fables and bedtime stories they narrated to us every night- are they the ones behind this miracle?<br>
                    Their existence is perhaps the sole reason why we as humans exist the way we do today. Spreading these values, these mantras for living a peaceful and harmonious life, seemed to be the core motive behind every religion in this world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The significance of ethics in every domain of our lives is <i>huge</i>. It is these very ethics that <i>evolved</i> us from primitive thinkers to multidimensional thoughtful <i>beings</i> that look out for one another, and who have <i>values</i> to defend. Can you think of any other species out there that live by some unanimously agreed-upon moral code of conduct? Perhaps not. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Being ethical is rewarding in itself. None can deny the immense satisfaction one experiences after doing a good deed with a pure heart. Morally strong people, communities and businesses are admired by all. When one promises security and stands by it, one gains true admiration and respect from the people. Especially in unprecedented times like these, when a bond of trust is as rare and precious as a diamond, ethical reasoning becomes an untold necessity before taking any decision.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But the most unfortunate fact is that these values meant to teach us peace and harmonious existence are increasingly becoming the <i>reasons</i> for destruction and bloodshed. Online wars against different groups of people are waged almost every day. Often, one’s innocent actions are incorrectly judged, criticized, and accused of being biased and insulting. 
                </p>

            <div class="intro4">

                    What was to prevent wars is now causing them.

                    All of this perhaps goes on to prove that one important, and probably the most crucial value that goes mostly un-taught, is to use that slimy little thing sitting inside the skull, and not just believe or reject anything <i>blindly</i>! I wish, someday, we’d all learn to follow principles that are synchronous with our hearts, and not our unbiased minds. Abiding by moral values can give one a great and fulfilling life, but if misinterpreted and believed blindly, it can lead to <i>irreversible disasters</i>.<br>
                    Think wisely.

                Highly reactive, continuously undergoes rapid changes in form and shape. Too unstable to store a pure sample due to which no detailed study on its properties has been conducted so far. Isolation and extraction of Truth has proven life-threatening to humans in the past. <br>
                Demand for the cheaper and more easily available synthetic Truth, in replacement of the more dangerous natural Truth, is rapidly on the rise. Ironically, natural resources of the element are reported to be in danger of permanent extinction.

                    If there’s one thing I’ve learnt in this life of mine so far, it is this- that the equation of an event involves such a vast multitude of variables and parameters, that to accurately judge one’s motives and analyse their actions is… well, a near-impossible task. Every little story has so many dimensions to it, that looking at it from any number of perspectives less than all of them will always give one the incomplete picture, the wrong picture. Funnily though, most of us fail to gauge this complexity. And as humans, ha, aren’t we just so quick to judge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now in a world like ours, where each of us has decisions to make- decisions that will affect not only us and those in our immediate circle, but also, in the long run, perhaps the future of an entire country and its people- access to true and correct information is an absolute necessity. And yet, it’s not been just once or twice occasionally that scams involving reputed news channels and newspapers have been exposed. It’s happening at an alarming frequency. Perhaps there’s one in the making this very second, looting and thriving for as long as fate decides to catch up. And yet, all we can do is go ablaze for a wee while, get a little angry, maybe shout a few curses, and continue depending on them for our daily dose of worldly matter. After all, for how long can we go on unsubscribing?
                </p>
                <p>
                    How fair is it anyway, to expect the entire world to do what’s supposed to be done, or what’s good, when most of the people involved in frauds probably didn’t even have a choice? It’s human nature after all. Selfishness is a quite significant by-product of human evolution, and when faced with a choice, the majority- probably including you and me- will choose the one with benefits for themselves instead of sacrificing themselves for the greater good of this big bad world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    School textbooks, academic references, history books… they aren’t left alone either. Their fragile pages are burdened with the weight of untold truths and unnecessarily glorified falsities- all creating a very distorted, incomplete version of reality. Half-truths, ladies and gentlemen, are many times deadlier than outright lies. The power of a little truth wrapped in layers upon layers of lies is unimaginably profound and has been well exploited throughout history by those skilled enough to wield it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So where is our precious little TRUTH then? Is it in the carefully drafted speeches that the leaders deliver? Is it in the daily faithful-only-to-viewers news banter with flashing headlines? Or is it in those leaked footage and audio tapes that are always cleverly brushed under the carpet? (not to forget, of course, the lengths they had to go to sometimes, to arrange for actors desperate enough to help them create their evidence!) What about the numbers and stats- surely they can’t be played with, right? Words of a witness? Encyclopaedias? TV reality shows?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Heck, can one even trust one’s own senses in a world so prone to manipulation?
